# Sql-Project
I conducted in-depth e-commerce sales analysis using SQL to extract, clean, and analyze real-world sales data. 

Key responsibilities included:
Data Extraction and Cleaning: Extracted sales data from the database using SQL queries Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. 
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.

Flipkart is one of India’s biggest E-commerce brands. They want to launch their business in Brazil. You are hired by Flipkart as a Data Analyst and your job is to help Flipkart set up its business in Brazil Market.  As we all know their different department required different types of information to set up their business in Brazil. Your job is to prepare a details report for each department.

Some of the requirements might be - 

- Operation team needs information about the supply chain so you're going to give them all the details about the company's supply chain.
- Sales team needs your help in working with the vendor and coming up with good offers to sell their products on Flipkart.
- Marketing team needs your help in making their launch offer in more customized manner.

Gather five helpful insights for each department's requirements. 

Keep in mind that the company's breakeven is one year so they can’t bear high customer acquisition costs.
